                             \\==================//

I never thought I would actually succeed in making my own items, let alone my own item upgrade mod to implement them. But I've managed to do it, although it did take some time, a lot of hard work, and help from a very experienced person (Weimer) to get me there.


Hope you guys (and girls) enjoy it.



                             //==================\\
                             || 2 - Installation ||
                             \\==================//

This mod runs on BGII SoA with or without ToB installed, and should work with all other WeiDU mods.

1 - Extract the main EXE file into your BGII main directory.
    e.g. "C:\Games\Baldurs Gate II"

2 - Run "setup-ruad.exe".

3 - Choose which components you would like to install.

You can un-install any component later by re-running "setup-ruad.exe".



                              //================\\
                              || 3 - Components ||
                              \\================//

                          /--------------------------\
                          | 1: Ruad Ro'fhessa  (SoA) |
                          \--------------------------/

Ruad is a brand new blacksmith who forges item upgrades, as well as a few brand new ones.

I won't spoil his location for you, but I will tell that he is near the Adventurer Mart.

Read ruad-spoilers.txt for his exact location, and a complete list of items and descriptions.

                          /--------------------------\
                          | 2: Ruad Ro'fhessa  (ToB) |
                          \--------------------------/

This makes Ruad ToB compatible, and puts him in your Pocket Plane.



                              //================\\

None (yet).

                            \\====================//

Version 29.2.0 (August 30, 2020)
- Updated Italian translation (by ilot).
- Updated French translation (by Gwendolyne).

Version 29.1.0 (July 19, 2020)
- Fixed an issue in "always.tpa" library: a missing variable might prevent installation in some cases (thanks burner1024 for reporting it).

Version beta 29.0.0 (Hune 30, 2020)
- Added ruad.ini metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Renamed Setup-Ruad.tp2 -> ruad.tp2 to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Replaced `AUTHOR` keyword with `SUPPORT`.
- Fixed a typo in `HANDLE_CHARSETS` function (replaced "infer_charset" with "infer_charsets").
- Added `REQUIRE_PREDICATE` process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games (replaced old `ACTION_IF NOT FILE_EXISTS "Data/25Dialog.bif"` process).
- Added components `DESIGNATED` numbers and "ruad_soa" and "ruad_tob" `LABELS`.
- Added always.tpa library.
- Externalized tp2 code into ruad_soa.tpa and ruad_tob.tpa libraries for more comfortable readability and maintenance.
- Added native EET, 1PP and ToBEx compatibility.
- Commented code as much as possible.
- Fixed many items (see https://github.com/SpellholdStudios/RuadRofhessaItemUpgrade for details).
- Converted inventory BAMs to EE: This feature attempts to modify traditional inventory BAMs so that both the large and small icons are utilized by the EE games. The inventory BAM must have two sequences, the first containing the "large" inventory icon frame and the second containing the "small" inventory icon frame to be processed. Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the override folder.
- Inventory item icons: fixed wrong transparency index (pure green [0.255.0] replaces old turquoise - a pretty annoying BAMWorkshop leftover :astonished:).
- dialog and script files: added Chapters compatibility with EET (variable "%bg2_chapter_n%" are evaluated to set continuity chapter numbers).
- ruad.d: remove DestroyAllEquipment() action whenever possible.
- Included BWP Fixpack Luca Piol's typo fix for ruad.d: replaced wrong misc6s item (Chunk of Illithium Alloy) with misc6w (Wooden Stake) to create Wooden Stake (u#blun03.itm).
- Provided a Ruad portrait for EE game.
- Second component (#10): removed `AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT` command and added a require main component process, otherwise mod will crash the game if first component is not installed.
- Added foreign languages WeiDU prompts whenever possible.
- Renamed "titles" and "setup" .tra files to more accurate "setup" and "items" .tra files.
- Updated "items.tra" files for compatibility with `GW_UPDATE_ITM_DESCRIPTION_TO_EE` WeiDU function requirements which automatically removes usability restrictions for EE games. And fixed restriction flags whenever relevant.
- Updated and renamed readme file to "ruad-readme-english.txt", then moved it into new "readme" folder.
- Renamed "american" language folder to "english".
- Removed unused files.
- Included Linux and Mac Os X versions in the same package (thanks AL|EN's Infinity Auto Packager tool!).
- Added archive libiconv-1.9.2-1-src.7z with iconv licence info.
- Uploaded mod to official Spellhold Studios GitHub mirror account.

Version 28 (22 November 2018 by Deratiseur)
- Added BG2EE compatibility.
- Mits of Shaiman (u#brac01.itm): included Lollorian's assorted ITM fixes ( http://www.shsforums.net/topic/42220-fixes-for-the-big-fixpack/page-35#entry543984 ) preventing a wrong op#18 (Maximum HP Modifier) setting that allowed the exploit of curing current HPs when equipping the item (fixed parametre2 to 3 - Cumulative Modifier, don't update current HP, instead of 0 - Cumulative Modifier).
