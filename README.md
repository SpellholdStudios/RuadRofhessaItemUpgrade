## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds Ruad, a new smith in Waukeen's Promenade, who improves items as well as forges some quite new ones.

<details><summary>Original note from the author</summary>
<p>

###### I never thought I would actually succeed in making my own items, let alone my own item upgrade mod to implement them. But I've managed to do it, although it did take some time, a lot of hard work, and help from a very experienced person (Weimer) to get me there.

###### Hope you guys (and girls) enjoy it.
</p>

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE), the conversion projects <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</a>.

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/60855-ruad-rofhessa-item-upgrade-updated-to-v29-with-ee-compatibility/">report them on the forum!</a><br>

>Although it is not required for Ruad to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-ruad.exe`__, un-install all previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: __ruad__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Ruad for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ruad folder and a setup-ruad.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-ruad.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-ruad.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Ruad for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ruad folder, setup-ruad and setup-ruad.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-ruad.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-ruad.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Ruad for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-ruad`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-ruad --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></div>


<hr>


## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component *`DESIGNATED`* number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.

## 

**0. Ruad Ro'fhessa (SoA)**<br />

Ruad is a brand new blacksmith who forges item upgrades, as well as a few brand new ones. I won't spoil his location for you, but I will tell that he is near the Adventurer Mart.

Please see <a href="https://spellholdstudios.github.io/readmes/ruad-spoilers.txt">ruad-spoilers.txt</a> for details (his exact location, and a complete list of items and descriptions).

## 

**10. Ruad Ro'fhessa (ToB)** (requires Ruad for SoA)<br />

This component makes Ruad ToB compatible, and puts him in your Pocket Plane.

- Added Dynamic Install Syntax (`After` and `Before` keywords) in *ruad.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Fixed WeiDU 'relative command execution' problem (renamed "*ruad*" sub-folder to "*rofhessa*").
- Updated French and German WeiDU prompts, and French translation (by Gwendolyne).
- Updated WeiDU installer to v247.

## 

##### Version 29.2.0 (August 30, 2020)

- Updated Italian translation (by ilot).
- Updated French translation (by Gwendolyne).

## 

##### Version 29.1.0 (July 19, 2020)

- Fixed an issue in "*always.tpa*" library: a missing variable might prevent installation in some cases (thanks burner1024 for reporting it).

## 

##### Version 29.0.0 (June 30, 2020)

- Added *ruad.ini* metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Renamed *Setup-Ruad.tp2* -> *ruad.tp2* to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
- Replaced `AUTHOR` keyword with `SUPPORT`.
- Fixed a typo in `HANDLE_CHARSETS` function (replaced *infer_charset* with *infer_charset<ins>s</ins>*).
- Added `REQUIRE_PREDICATE` process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games (replaced old `ACTION_IF NOT FILE_EXISTS "Data/25Dialog.bif"` process).
- Added components `DESIGNATED` numbers and "*ruad_soa*" and "*ruad_tob*" `LABELS`.
- Added "*always.tpa*" library.
- Externalized tp2 code into *ruad_soa.tpa* and *ruad_tob.tpa* libraries for more comfortable readability and maintenance.
- Added native EET, 1PP and ToBEx compatibility.
- Commented code as much as possible.
- Converted inventory BAMs to EE: This feature attempts to modify traditional inventory BAMs so that both the large and small icons are utilized by the EE games.

Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the *override* folder.

- Second component (#10): removed `AT_INTERACTIVE_EXIT` command and added a require main component process, otherwise mod will crash the game if first component is not installed.
- Added foreign languages WeiDU prompts whenever possible.
- Renamed "*titles*" and "*setup*" .tra files to more accurate "*setup*" and "*items*" .tra files.
- Updated *items.tra* files for compatibility with `GW_UPDATE_ITM_DESCRIPTION_TO_EE` WeiDU function requirements which automatically removes usability restrictions for EE games. And fixed restriction flags whenever relevant.
- Updated and renamed readme file to *ruad-readme-english.txt*, then moved it into new "*readme*" folder.
- Renamed "*american*" language folder to "*english*".
- Removed unused files.
- Included Linux and Mac Os X versions in the same package (thanks AL|EN's Infinity Auto Packager tool!).
