## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview


I never thought I would actually succeed in making my own items, let alone my own item upgrade mod to implement them. But I've managed to do it, although it did take some time, a lot of hard work, and help from a very experienced person (Weimer) to get me there.

This mod adds Ruad, a new smith in Waukeen's Promenade, who improves items as well as forges some quite new ones.

Hope you guys (and girls) enjoy it.


<hr>


## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games: the original Baldur's Gate II (BG2 or just SoA) with or without the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE), the conversion projects Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT) and Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!<br>

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **setup-ruad.exe**, uninstall the previously installed main component and delete the :file_folder: ruad folder.</em>

<em>When installing or uninstalling, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.</em>

**Disable any antivirus** or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: ruad folder and a setup-ruad.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **setup-ruad.exe** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **setup-ruad.exe** in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change the component settings.

## 

#### Note for Complete Uninstallation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using **`setup-ruad --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component DESIGNATED number which gives it a fixed install position and allows automated installers to specify component choices.<br /><br />


**0. Ruad Ro'fhessa (SoA)**<br />

Ruad is a brand new blacksmith who forges item upgrades, as well as a few brand new ones. I won't spoil his location for you, but I will tell that he is near the Adventurer Mart.

Please read <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GwendolyneFreddy/RuadRofhessaItemUpgrade/tree/master/ruad/readme/ruad-spoilers.txt">ruad-spoilers.txt</a> for details (his exact location, and a complete list of items and descriptions.

## 

**10. Ruad Ro'fhessa (ToB)**<br />

This component makes Ruad ToB compatible, and puts him in your Pocket Plane.

## <a name="versions" id="versions"></a>Versions History

##### Version 29.0.0 by Gwendolyne (, 2019)

- Major updates:
	- Renamed Setup-Ruad.tp2 -> ruad.tp2 to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
	- Added ruad.ini metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".
	- 
	- Converted inventory BAMs to EE: This feature attempts to modify traditional inventory BAMs so that both the large and small icons are utilized by the EE games. The inventory BAM must have two sequences, the first containing the "large" inventory icon frame and the second containing the "small" inventory icon frame to be processed. Inventory icon BAMs in the bam folder that meet these requirements are patched and saved back to the override folder.
	- Inventory items icons: fixed wrong transparency index (pure green replaces old turquoise - BAMWorkshop leftover :astonished:).
	- 
	- Updated tra files for compatibility with GW_UPDATE_ITM_DESCRIPTION_TO_EE WeiDU function requirements which automatically removes usability restrictions for EE games.
	- Added missing ruad.tra files in reload array HANDLE_CHARSETS function.
	- Renamed titles and setup .tra files to more accurate setup and items .tra files.
	- Renamed american and italian tra folders to english and italiano.
	- 
	- Reorganized components (DESIGNATED number).
	- Added REQUIRE_PREDICATE process to avoid installing the mod in inaccurate games.
	- Replaced AUTHOR keyword with SUPPORT.
	- Updated and renamed readme file to <em>ruad-readme-english.txt</em>.
	- Updated French and English translations (Gwendolyne).

- Added Spanish WeiDU prompts.

- Items updates:
	- Hard-coded items inventory and headers icons in .itm files to avoid writing them in installation process.
	- Appended tooltip.2da whenever relevant.
	- Blade of the Red Rose +4: 

- ruad.d: rewrote old-school code and fixed typos that were taking and deleting wrong items (Cloak of Perfection, Swords of Freedom and Mace of Disruption +3).
